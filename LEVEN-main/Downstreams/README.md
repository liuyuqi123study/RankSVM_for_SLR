# Downstream Experiments
We explore the use of LEVEN on two downstream tasks. We simply use event as side information to promote the performance of [Legal Judgment Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02478.pdf) and [Similar Case Retrieval](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/publications/SIGIR2021Ma.pdf).

## LJP

The LJP folder contains code for Legal Judgment Prediction task.

## SCR

The SCR folder contains code for Similar Case Retrieval task.
